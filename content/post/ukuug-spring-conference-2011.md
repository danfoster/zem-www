I recently attended UKUUG's annual [Large Installation Systems
Administration][] (LISA) conference, this year hosted in Leeds over 2
days.

Overall I was very impressed with the event, at some points I was torn
with that track to go on. In the end I attended the following:

- A bird's-eye view on DNSSEC (Jan-Piet Mens)
- Managing distributed web services with OpenNMS (Dr. Craig Gallen)
- Unbound as a caching validating DNSSEC resolver (Jan-Piet Mens)
- IPv6 update from a broadband ISP (Adrian Kennard)
- The Future of Configuration Management -- Latest developments from Cfengine (Mark Burgess)
- FusionInventory and GLPI (Fabrice Flore-Thebault)
- The benefit of BGP for every service provider (Thomas Mangin)
- DNSSEC zone-signing tool chest (Jan-Piet Mens)
- Scale out Datacenter Architecture (Bernd Erk)
- Digital Forensics in Large Scale Environments (Si Biles)
- Large Scale file storage with MogileFS (Stuart Teasdale)
- OpenStack: Towards a fully open cloud (Thierry Carrez)
- PostgreSQL: New features for Large Systems Administration (Simon Riggs)

Some of the above were very interesting, which I hope to blog about in
detail in the near future.

The evening was very enjoyable and I fully enjoyed taking to like minded
people. Although not a HE based conference, I was pleasantly suprised to
meet fellow sysadmins from other Universities. Some as close as Bath,
yes it takes a trip up to the north to meet people from a city on my
doorstep.
