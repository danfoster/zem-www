This weekend I took part in the [Ludum Dare 26 Competition](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/), where the
theme was "Minimalism". My entry is **Filler**.

Aim
===

The aim of **filler** is fill the holes in the grid with the *minimum*
number of block pieces as possible. To achieve this, try to prevent
blocks from overlapping when placing them. You can rotate and flip each
block piece. If succeed in filling the hole with the minimum number of
block pieces, your score multiplier will increase.

Don't spend too long deciding where to place your piece. If the timer
runs out, you will lose a life. Try to get as many points as possible
before losing all your lives.

Controls
========

-   **Left Click** on a block piece on the right hand side to pick it
    up.
-   **Left Click** while holding a block piece on the grid to place it.
-   **Right Click** while holding a block piece to flip it.
-   **Mouse Wheel** while holding a block piece to rotate it.
